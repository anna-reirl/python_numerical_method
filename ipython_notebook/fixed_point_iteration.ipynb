    "## 3.2 Fixed-Point Iteration\n",
    "A $\\mathit{fixed point}$ for a function is a number at which the value of the function does not change when the function is applied.\n",
    "### Definition of a Fixed Point\n",
    "The number $p$ is a $\\mathbf{fixed \\space point}$ for a given function $g$ if $g(p)=p$.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "We consider the problem of finding solutions to fixed-point problems and the connection between the fixed-point problems and the root-finding problems we wish to solve. Root-finding problems and fixed-point problems are equivalent classes in the following sense:\n",
    "- Given a root-finding problem $f(p)=0$, we can define function $g$ with a fixed point at p in a number of ways, for example, as $g(x)=x-f(x) \\space\\space or \\space as \\space\\space g(x)=x+3f(x).$\n",
    "- Conversely, if the function $g$ has a fixed point at $p$, then the function defined by $f(x)=x-g(x)$ has a zero at p.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "Determine any fixed points of the function $g(x)=X^{2}-2$.\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "A fixed point $p$ for $g$ has the property that \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$p=g(p)=p^{2}-2, \\space\\space which \\space implies \\space that \\space\\space 0=p^{2}-p-2=(p+1)(p-2).$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A fixed point for $g$ occurs precisely when the graph of $y=g(x)$ intersects the graph of $y=x$, so $g$ has two fixed points, one at $p=-1$ and the other at $p=2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem (Fixed-Point Theorem)\n",
    "Let $g \\in C[a,b]$ be such that $g(x)\\in [a,b],$ for all $x$ in $[a,b].$ Suppose, in addition, that $g'$ exists on $(a,b)$ and that a constant $0<k<1$ exists with \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\big|g'(x)\\big| \\leq k, \\space\\space for \\space all \\space x\\in(a,b).$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Then, for any number $p_{0}$ in $[a,b],$ the sequence defined by\n",
    "$$p_{n}=g(p_{n-1}), \\space n \\geq 1,$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "converges to the unique fixed point $p$ in $[a,b].$\n",
    "### Corollary\n",
    "If $g$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Theorem, then bounds for the error involved in using $p_{n}$ to approximate $p$ are given by\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\big| p_{n} - p \\big| \\leq k^{n} \\space max\\{p_{0} - a, b - p_{0}\\}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\\big| p_{n} - p \\big| \\leq \\frac{k^{n}}{1-k}\\big| p_{1} - p_{0} \\big|, \\space\\space for \\space all \\space\\space n \\geq 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixed-Point Iteration\n",
    "To approximate the fixed point of a functioni $g$, we choose an initial approximation $p_{0}$ and generate the sequence $\\{p_{n}\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ by letting $p_{n}=g(p_{n-1})$, for each $n \\geq 1$. If the sequence converges to $p$ and $g$ is continuous, then\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$p=\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} p_{n} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(p_{n-1}) = g\\bigg(\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} p_{n-1}\\bigg) = g(p),$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and a solution to $x=g(x)$ is obtained. This technique is called $\\mathbf{fixed-point}$, or $\\mathbf{functional \\space iteration}$. \n",
